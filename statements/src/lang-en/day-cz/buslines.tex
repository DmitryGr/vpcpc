In the Czech city called Kocourkov they have a spectacular public transportion system.
It consists of $N$ bus stops and $N-1$ bidirectional roads, each road connecting two bus stops.
It is possible to get from each bus stop to every other using a sequence of roads.

Every morning, from each bus stop depart $N-1$ buses, each bus heading into different bus stop.
Each bus stops at every bus stop on the path between the departure and destination bus stop, both of them including.

At every bus stop there must be a timetable listing all the buses that stops on that particular stop.
You are now wondering, how many buses are listed on each timetable.

\heading{Task}

You are given the description of the traffic system in Kocourkov.
For every bus stop in the city calculate the number of buses that stop on that particular stop.

\heading{Input}

First line contains an integer $N$, the number of bus stops in the city (stops are numbered from $1$ to $N$).
The following $N-1$ lines describe the roads in the city.
Each line contains two different integers $1 \le x, y \le N$ meaning that there is a road connecting bus stops $x$ and $y$.

\smallskip
\noindent
It holds $1 \leq N \leq 10^6$.\\
In the $20\%$ of testcases $N \leq 100$.\\
In the $40\%$ of testcases $N \leq 1000$.

\heading{Output}

The output consists of $N$ lines. The $i$-th line should contain a signle integer, the number of buses that stop on the $i$-th bus stop.
