VPCPC 2014 Plans
================

Day CZ
------

  * **paths** - (combinatorial) number of different paths in tree
  * **(taskname)** - (open data) TBD
  * **treasure** - (graph) generalized binary search on tree


Day HU
------

  * **(critical)** - (graph) Find all critical nodes of a dag in linear time
  * **(networks)** - (geometry) Find a connecting segment of two networks in linear time
  * **(nextperm)** - (combinatorial) Find the next 3-1-2 pattern avoiding permutation


Day PL
------

  * **(sorting)** - (longest increasing subsequence) given a set of numbers, count its subsets, which have some properties
  * **(tree)** - (divide and conquer) given a tree, find a path with the highest average of weights, the path must be longer than k
  * **(game)** - (number theory) recursive euclidean algorithm plus modular arithmetic


Day SK
------

  * **peaks** - (geometry) 3D with sweeping and rotational sorting
  * **biunion** - (graph) union find but whith detecting 2-connected components
  * **hotel** - (BST / interval tree) filling and releasing room sequences
