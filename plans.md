VPCPC 2014 Plans
================

Day CZ
------

  * **buslines** - (combinatorial) number of different paths in tree
  * **cutting** - (open data) separate points in a plane by the least amount of lines
  * **investigation** - (graph) generalized binary search on tree


Day HU
------

  * **critical** - (graph) Find all critical nodes of a dag in linear time
  * **networks** - (geometry) Find a connecting segment of two networks in linear time
  * **nextperm** - (combinatorial) Find the next 3-1-2 pattern avoiding permutation


Day PL
------

  * **sorting** - (longest increasing subsequence) given a set of numbers, count its subsets, which have some properties
  * **tree** - (divide and conquer) given a tree, find a path with the highest average of weights, the path must be longer than k
  * **game** - (number theory) recursive euclidean algorithm plus modular arithmetic


Day SK
------
 
  * **shades** - (stringology) Aho-Corasic on fractions
  * **hyperways** - (graph) union find but whith detecting 2-connected components
  * **malloc** - (BST / interval tree) filling and releasing room sequences


Day MIX 1
---------

  * (*CZ*) - **universities** - (graph) longest path in tree containing same number of black and white vertices
  * (*HU*) - **newtree** - (geometry) find a triangle containing a given point
  * (*PL*) - **wall** - (dynamic programming) computing answer for every interval of a sequence with marked end
  * (*SK*) - **rubic** - (data structures) resizable interval tree over permutations


Day MIX 2
---------

  * (*CZ*) - **socks** - (graph) shortest **path** in graph from A to B, containing vertex C
  * (*HU*) - **tickets** - (greedy) scheduling, union-find
  * (*PL*) - **posters** - (interval tree) find the area of a sum of rectangles intersected with another rectangle (many queries)
  * (*SK*) - **(taskname)** - (geometry) find out the last time when set of parallel shrinking segments can be intersected by line.
